```sql

    ) AS percentile
  FROM health.user_logs
  WHERE measure = 'weight'
)
SELECT
  measure_value,
  -- these are examples of window functions below
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY measure_value DESC) as row_number_order,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY measure_value DESC) as rank_order,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY measure_value DESC) as dense_rank_order
FROM percentile_values
WHERE percentile = 100
ORDER BY measure_value DESC;
