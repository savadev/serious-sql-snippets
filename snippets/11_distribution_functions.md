## Distribution functions

### 1. Summary statistics.

```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(MIN(measure_value), 2) AS minimum_value,
  ROUND(MAX(measure_value), 2) AS maximum_value,
  ROUND(AVG(measure_value), 2) AS mean_value,
  ROUND(
    -- this function actually returns a float which is incompatible with ROUND!
    -- we use this cast function to convert the output type to NUMERIC
    CAST(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY measure_value) AS NUMERIC),
    2
  ) AS median_value,
  ROUND(
    MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY measure_value),
    2
  ) AS mode_value,
  ROUND(STDDEV(measure_value), 2) AS standard_deviation,
  ROUND(VARIANCE(measure_value), 2) AS variance_value
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'weight';
```

Example questions:
* Does it make sense to have such low minimum values and such a high value?
* Why is the average value 28,786kg but the median is 75.98kg?
* The standard deviation of values is WAY too large at 1,062,759kg
